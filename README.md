#### âœ¨ My contributions:

  - [Programs to Madagascar open-source seismic processing package](https://github.com/ahay/src/tree/master/user/dirack):
The programs _sfvfsacrsnh_ and _sfnhcrssurf_ are C programs adapted to the Madagascar package. 
The mains objective of these programs is to optimize the zero offset Common Reflection Surface (CRS) parameters, RN, RNIP, BETA 
that best fits a non-hyperbolic CRS approximation surface with a reflection traveltime surface extracted from a seismic data cube
(seismic data organized in CMP x Offset X Time coordinates). The result of that parameters optmization is used in CRS stack and is
achieved using Very Fast Simulated Aneelling (VFSA) global optimization algorithm.

#### ðŸ”­ Projects I'm currently working on:

- [ProSU](https://github.com/gpgeof/proSU): A Shell Script interface to Seismic Unix (SU) package.
