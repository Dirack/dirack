#### âœ¨ My contributions:

  - [Programs to Madagascar open-source seismic processing package](https://github.com/ahay/src/tree/master/user/dirack):
The programs _sfvfsacrsnh_ and _sfnhcrssurf_ are C programs adapted to the Madagascar package. 
The mains objective of these programs is to optimize the zero offset Common Reflection Surface (CRS) parameters, RN, RNIP, BETA 
that best fits a non-hyperbolic CRS approximation surface with a reflection traveltime surface extracted from a seismic data cube
(seismic data organized in CMP x Offset X Time coordinates). The result of that parameters optmization is used in CRS stack and is
achieved using Very Fast Simulated Aneelling (VFSA) global optimization algorithm.

- New Madagascar Computational Recipes:
[kimodel.py](https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/Recipes/kimodel.py), to generate a multi-layer model and apply Kirchhoff-Newton modeling on it,
 and [velocityAnalysis.py](https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/Recipes/velocityAnalysis.py), to do velocity Analysis, automatic picking,
 NMO correction and stack.
 
 **A "computational recipe" is a python
 script that defines functions to facilitate seismic processing steps with Madagascar package. Those recipes have a
[SConstruct](https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/dirack/examples/modelAndStack/SConstruct) usage example available**
 
#### ðŸ”­ Projects I'm currently working on:

- [ProSU](https://github.com/gpgeof/proSU): A Shell Script interface to Seismic Unix (SU) package.
- [Madagascar Recipes](https://github.com/Dirack/madagascarRecipes): Computational recipes to seismic processing with Madagascar package.
- [creVelocityInversion](https://github.com/Dirack/creVelocityInversion): Velocity inversion algorithm using Common Reflection Element (CRE) traveltime approximation.
- [diffractionSimulator](https://github.com/Dirack/diffractionSimulator): SConscripts to simulate diffraction hyperbolas in the stacked section.
